Like having a light snack instead of a full formal meal, but for learning!\nThe name implies that you can approach learning in a casual, snackable way while still getting the benefits of academic understanding. It’s meant to make learning feel less intimidating and more enjoyable.",

Historically, snake venom was believed to have evolved once, at the base of the Caenophidia, or derived snakes. Molecular studies published beginning in 2006 suggested that venom originated just once among a putative clade of reptiles, called Toxicofera, approximately 170 million years ago.[7] Under this hypothesis, the original toxicoferan venom was a very simple set of proteins that were assembled in a pair of glands. Subsequently, this set of proteins diversified in the various lineages of toxicoferans, including Serpentes, Anguimorpha, and Iguania: several snake lineages also lost the ability to produce venom.[8][9] The Toxicoferan hypothesis was challenged by studies in the mid-2010s, including a 2015 study which found that venom proteins had homologs in many other tissues in the Burmese python.[10][11] The study therefore suggested that venom had evolved independently in different reptile lineages, including once in the Caenophid snakes.[10] Venom containing most extant toxin families is believed to have been present in the last common ancestor of the Caenophidia: these toxins subsequently underwent tremendous diversification, accompanied by changes in the morphology of venom glands and delivery systems.[12]\nSnake venom evolution is thought to be driven by an evolutionary arms race between venom proteins and prey physiology.[13] The common mechanism of evolution is thought to be gene duplication followed by natural selection for adaptive traits.[14] The adaptations produced by this process include venom more toxic to specific prey in several lineages,[15][16][17] proteins that pre-digest prey,[18] and a method to track down prey after a bite.[19] These various adaptations of venom have also led to considerable debate about the definition of venom and venomous snakes.[20] Changes in the diet of a lineage have been linked to atrophication of the venom.[8][9]\n\n\narticle.intro is a title and some paragraphs of content before table of contents starts.

The standard defines the \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\" series of paper sizes, which includes the A4, the most commonly available paper size worldwide. Two supplementary standards, ISO 217 and ISO 269, define related paper sizes; the ISO 269 \"C\" series is commonly listed alongside the A and B sizes.\\n\\nAll ISO 216, ISO 217 and ISO 269 paper sizes (except some envelopes) have the same aspect ratio, √2:1, within rounding to millimetres. This ratio has the unique property that when cut or folded in half widthways, the halves also have the same aspect ratio. Each ISO paper size is one half of the area of the next larger size in the same series.[1]',\n 'statistics': 'Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures (such as the \"variation\" among and between groups) used to analyze the differences between groups. It uses F-test by comparing variance between groups and taking noise, or assumed normal distribution of group, into consideration by dividing by variance between elements in a group. ANOVA was developed by the statistician Ronald Fisher. ANOVA is based on the law of total variance, where the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal, and therefore generalizes the t-test beyond two means. In other words, the ANOVA is used to test the difference between two or more means.',\n 'obscure': 'Writing systems are used to record human language, and may be classified according to certain common features.\\n\\nThe usual name of the script is given first; the name of the languages in which the script is written follows (in brackets), particularly in the case where the language name differs from the script name.

It is maintained by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was first published in 1988, with updates in 1991, 2000, 2004, and 2019, and an amendment in 2022.[1] The standard provides a well-defined, unambiguous method of representing calendar dates and times in worldwide communications, especially to avoid misinterpreting numeric dates and times when such data is transferred between countries with different conventions for writing numeric dates and times.\\n\\nISO\\xa08601 applies to these representations and formats: dates, in the Gregorian calendar (including the proleptic Gregorian calendar); times, based on the 24-hour timekeeping system, with optional UTC offset; time intervals; and combinations thereof.[2] The standard does not assign specific meaning to any element of the dates/times represented: the meaning of any element depends on the context of its use. Dates and times represented cannot use words that do not have a specified numerical meaning within the standard (thus excluding names of years in the Chinese calendar), or that do not use computer characters (excludes images or sounds).[2]\\n\\nIn representations that adhere to the ISO\\xa08601 interchange standard, dates and times are arranged such that the greatest temporal term (typically a year) is placed at the left and each successively lesser term is placed to the right of the previous term. Representations must be written in a combination of Arabic numerals and the specific computer characters (such as \"‐\", \":\", \"T\", \"W\", \"Z\") that are assigned specific meanings within the standard; that is, such commonplace descriptors of dates (or parts of dates) as \"January\", \"Thursday\", or \"New Year\\'s Day\" are not allowed in interchange representations within the standard.'}\n\n\nNone means we got an error.
